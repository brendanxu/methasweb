# Video Assets for Hero Section

## How to add videos

1. Place your hero background videos in this directory
2. Recommended filenames:
   - `hero-climate-action.mp4` (Primary format)
   - `hero-climate-action.webm` (Backup format for better browser compatibility)

## Video Specifications

### Technical Requirements
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (video will loop automatically)
- **Resolution**: Minimum 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9
- **File Size**: Keep under 5MB for optimal performance
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec) and WebM

### Content Guidelines
- Focus on climate action, sustainability, or nature themes
- Ensure the content works well with text overlay
- Avoid rapid movements or high contrast changes that might affect text readability
- Consider the looping effect - ensure smooth transitions from end to beginning

### Performance Considerations
- Videos are only loaded on desktop browsers (hidden on mobile for performance)
- Mobile devices will show a static background image instead
- Video includes a poster image as fallback during loading
